# Creating an S3 Bucket

In order to create an S3 bucket with scoped credentials to access that bucket, we recommend using `s3-credentials`.

```
pip install s3-credentials
```

Now run `s3-credentials` and capture the output. We'll immediately send this to fly.io encrypted secret storage.
You will need to provide the `BUCKET` name and `BUCKET_REGION`. Choose the closest AWS region.
```
s3-credentials create-bucket "${BUCKET}" --region ${BUCKET_REGION}
```

Use the output of the above command to fill out the following environment variables in your template:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${ACCESS_KEY}
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}
AWS_REGION=${BUCKET_REGION}
STORAGE_BUCKET=${BUCKET}
RELAY_SERVER_STORAGE=s3://${BUCKET}/
```
