**Self-hosted real-time collaboration and web publishing for Obsidian.**

> Edit together. Publish to the web. Keep your data on your server.

## The Problem

Obsidian is great for personal notes. But when your team needs to collaborate:
- **Obsidian Sync** has no real-time collab and costs $8/user/month
- **Notion/Confluence** means leaving Obsidian and losing your workflow
- **Git-based sync** means merge conflicts on every concurrent edit
- **Obsidian Publish** is $8/month with limited customization and no access control

You want your team in Obsidian, editing together, publishing docs — without giving up data control.

## The Solution

**EVC Team Relay** is self-hosted infrastructure that adds real-time collaboration and web publishing to Obsidian. CRDT-based, local-first, fully under your control.

---

## Features

### Real-time Collaboration
- **Live editing** — CRDT-based sync via y-sweet (Yjs), no merge conflicts
- **Offline-first** — edit without connection, sync seamlessly when back online
- **Folder sharing** — share entire folders with viewer/editor permissions

### Web Publishing
- **Publish notes to the web** — internal wiki, client portal, or public docs
- **Access control** — public, protected (link + token), or private (authenticated)
- **Custom domains** — `docs.yourdomain.com`
- **Live preview** — see your published site at [docs.entire.vc/team-relay/Demo](https://docs.entire.vc/team-relay/Demo) (example)

### Enterprise Ready
- **Authentication** — OAuth/OIDC, email/password, 2FA
- **Audit logs** — who did what and when
- **Webhooks** — integrate with your automation
- **Monitoring** — Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
- **Docker Compose** — one command to deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/entire-vc/evc-team-relay.git
